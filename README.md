# Homer-Donut-Dash

This is a Simpsons inspired snake game. The yellow head represents Homer Simpson demonstrating his joy when eating a pink cube (donut) or running into the walls triggering game over. I added new features such as a background and scoring system to keep track of points. Due to GitHub, the game's music does not work on a cloud based environment and will work if ran on local machines. I encourage anyone reading this to play and see what their top score is! In the future, if enough players play, I will post a scoreboard rankings system for all to see!
